### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

A question: How can technology help people who don't know how to use it?

An answer: It can't. You need quality documentation to empower your end users. Tech alone is hard. Tech with docs is easy. 

#### I am:

- Experienced with **Microsoft Office**
- Familiar with **Madcap Flare**
- A capable creator of **2d and 3d graphics**
- Happy to edit **video content**
- Currently **ready to join your team**

You can see examples of my professional work below or check out my employment history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-levine/). My phone number and email address are on my CV; I look forward to hearing from you. I'm a technical writer. Let me make your tech easy.
