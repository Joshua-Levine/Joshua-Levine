### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer who believes the purpose of technology is to benefit humanity. 

A question: How can one derive benefit from something unusable?

An answer: As a technical writer, I make even the most esoteric of technologies comprehensible to the user.  My calling is ensuring that end users are able to easily use what developers have worked so hard to create.
